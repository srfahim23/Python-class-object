# Python Class/Object
Python is an object orineted programming language.

Almost everthing in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.


# Create a class
To create a class, use the keyword class:

Example
Create  a class named MyClass, with a property named x:

    class MyClass:
        x = 5

    print(MyClass)
