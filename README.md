# Python Class/Object
Python is an object orineted programming language.

Almost everthing in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.


# Create a class
To create a class, use the keyword class:

Example
Create  a class named MyClass, with a property named x:

    class MyClass:
        x = 5

    print(MyClass)    


# Create Object
Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:

Example
Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:

    clss MyClass:
        x = 5

    p1 = MyClass()
    print(p1.x)
